有晚上、有早晨、是第三日。
And the evening and the morning were the third day.
並要發光在天空、普照在地上．事就這樣成了。
And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so.
有晚上、有早晨、是第四日。
And the evening and the morning were the fourth day.
有晚上、有早晨、是第五日。
And the evening and the morning were the fifth day.
至於地上的走獸、和空中的飛鳥、並各樣爬在地上有生命的物、我將青草賜給他們作食物．事就這樣成了。
And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so.
