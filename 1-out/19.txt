那兩個天使晚上到了所多瑪．羅得正坐在所多瑪城門口．看見他們、就起來迎接、臉伏於地下拜、
And there came two angels to Sodom at even; and Lot sat in the gate of Sodom: and Lot seeing them rose up to meet them; and he bowed himself with his face toward the ground;
說、我主阿、請你們到僕人家裡洗洗腳、住一夜、清早起來再走．他們說、不、我們要在街上過夜。
And he said, Behold now, my lords, turn in, I pray you, into your servant's house, and tarry all night, and wash your feet, and ye shall rise up early, and go on your ways. And they said, Nay; but we will abide in the street all night.
羅得切切的請他們、他們這纔進去到他屋裡．羅得為他們預備筵席、烤無酵餅、他們就喫了。
And he pressed upon them greatly; and they turned in unto him, and entered into his house; and he made them a feast, and did bake unleavened bread, and they did eat.
他們還沒有躺下、所多瑪城裡各處的人、連老帶少、都來圍住那房子．
But before they lay down, the men of the city, even the men of Sodom, compassed the house round, both old and young, all the people from every quarter:
呼叫羅得說、今日晚上到你這裡來的人在哪裡呢．把他們帶出來、任我們所為。
And they called unto Lot, and said unto him, Where are the men which came in to thee this night? bring them out unto us, that we may know them.
羅得出來、把門關上、到眾人那裡、
And Lot went out at the door unto them, and shut the door after him,
說、眾弟兄請你們不要作這惡事。
And said, I pray you, brethren, do not so wickedly.
我有兩個女兒、還是處女、容我領出來任憑你們的心願而行、只是這兩個人既然到我舍下、不要向他們作甚麼。
Behold now, I have two daughters which have not known man; let me, I pray you, bring them out unto you, and do ye to them as is good in your eyes: only unto these men do nothing; for therefore came they under the shadow of my roof.
眾人說、退去罷．又說、這個人來寄居、還想要作官哪．現在我們要害你比害他們更甚、眾人就向前擁擠羅得、要攻破房門。
And they said, Stand back. And they said again, This one fellow came in to sojourn, and he will needs be a judge: now will we deal worse with thee, than with them. And they pressed sore upon the man, even Lot, and came near to break the door.
只是那二人伸出手來、將羅得拉進屋去、把門關上．
But the men put forth their hand, and pulled Lot into the house to them, and shut to the door.
並且使門外的人、無論老少、眼都昏迷．他們摸來摸去、總尋不著房門。
And they smote the men that were at the door of the house with blindness, both small and great: so that they wearied themselves to find the door.
二人對羅得說、你這裡還有甚麼人麼．無論是女婿、是兒女、和這城中一切屬你的人、你都要將他們從這地方帶出去。
And the men said unto Lot, Hast thou here any besides? son in law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whatsoever thou hast in the city, bring them out of this place:
我們要毀滅這地方、因為城內罪惡的聲音、在耶和華面前甚大、耶和華差我們來、要毀滅這地方。
For we will destroy this place, because the cry of them is waxen great before the face of the LORD; and the LORD hath sent us to destroy it.
羅得就出去、告訴娶了他女兒的女婿們、〔娶了或作將要娶〕說、你們起來離開這地方、因為耶和華要毀滅這城．他女婿們卻以為他說的是戲言。
And Lot went out, and spake unto his sons in law, which married his daughters, and said, Up, get you out of this place; for the LORD will destroy this city. But he seemed as one that mocked unto his sons in law.
天明了、天使催逼羅得說、起來、帶著你的妻子、和你在這裡的兩個女兒出去、免得你因這城裡的罪惡、同被剿滅。
And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot, saying, Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters, which are here; lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city.
但羅得遲延不走．二人因為耶和華憐恤羅得、就拉著他的手、和他妻子的手、並他兩個女兒的手、把他們領出來、安置在城外。
And while he lingered, the men laid hold upon his hand, and upon the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters; the LORD being merciful unto him: and they brought him forth, and set him without the city.
領他們出來以後、就說、逃命罷．不可回頭看、也不可在平原站住、要往山上逃跑、免得你被剿滅。
And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad, that he said, Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay thou in all the plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed.
羅得對他們說、我主阿、不要如此．
And Lot said unto them, Oh, not so, my LORD:
你僕人已經在你眼前蒙恩、你又向我顯出莫大的慈愛、救我的性命、我不能逃到山上去、恐怕這災禍臨到我、我便死了。
Behold now, thy servant hath found grace in thy sight, and thou hast magnified thy mercy, which thou hast shewed unto me in saving my life; and I cannot escape to the mountain, lest some evil take me, and I die:
看哪、這座城又小又近、容易逃到、這不是一個小的麼．求你容我逃到那裡、我的性命就得存活。
Behold now, this city is near to flee unto, and it is a little one: Oh, let me escape thither, (is it not a little one?) and my soul shall live.
天使對他說、這事我也應允你、我不傾覆你所說的這城、
And he said unto him, See, I have accepted thee concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow this city, for the which thou hast spoken.
你要速速的逃到那城、因為你還沒有到那裡我不能作甚麼。因此那城名叫瑣珥。〔瑣珥就是小的意思〕
Haste thee, escape thither; for I cannot do anything till thou be come thither. Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar.
羅得到了瑣珥、日頭已經出來了。
The sun was risen upon the earth when Lot entered into Zoar.
當時耶和華將硫磺與火、從天上耶和華那裡、降與所多瑪和蛾摩拉、
Then the LORD rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the LORD out of heaven;
把那些城、和全平原、並城裡所有的居民、連地上生長的、都毀滅了。
And he overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground.
羅得的妻子在後邊回頭一看、就變成了一根鹽柱。
But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt.
亞伯拉罕清早起來、到了他從前站在耶和華面前的地方、
And Abraham gat up early in the morning to the place where he stood before the LORD:
向所多瑪、和蛾摩拉、與平原的全地觀看．不料、那地方煙氣上騰、如同燒�o一般。
And he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the plain, and beheld, and, lo, the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace.
當　神毀滅平原諸城的時候、他記念亞伯拉罕、正在傾覆羅得所住之城的時候、就打發羅得從傾覆之中出來。
And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in the which Lot dwelt.
羅得因為怕住在瑣珥、就同他兩個女兒從瑣珥上去住在山裡．他和兩個女兒住在一個洞裡。
And Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and his two daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in Zoar: and he dwelt in a cave, he and his two daughters.
大女兒對小女兒說、我們的父親老了、地上又無人按著世上的常規、進到我們這裡．
And the firstborn said unto the younger, Our father is old, and there is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner of all the earth:
來、我們可以叫父親喝酒、與他同寢．這樣、我們好從他存留後裔。
Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.
於是那夜他們叫父親喝酒、大女兒就進去和他父親同寢．他幾時躺下、幾時起來、父親都不知道。
And they made their father drink wine that night: and the firstborn went in, and lay with her father; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.
第二天、大女兒對小女兒說、我昨夜與父親同寢、今夜我們再叫他喝酒、你可以進去與他同寢．這樣、我們好從父親存留後裔．
And it came to pass on the morrow, that the firstborn said unto the younger, Behold, I lay yesternight with my father: let us make him drink wine this night also; and go thou in, and lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.
於是那夜他們又叫父親喝酒、小女兒起來與他父親同寢．他幾時躺下、幾時起來、父親都不知道。
And they made their father drink wine that night also: and the younger arose, and lay with him; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.
這樣、羅得的兩個女兒、都從他父親懷了孕。
Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by their father.
大女兒生了兒子、給他起名叫摩押、就是現今摩押人的始祖。
And the first born bare a son, and called his name Moab: the same is the father of the Moabites unto this day.
小女兒也生了兒子、給他起名叫便亞米、就是現今亞捫人的始祖。
And the younger, she also bare a son, and called his name Benammi: the same is the father of the children of Ammon unto this day.
